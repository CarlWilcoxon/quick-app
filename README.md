# "Quick" app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). I originally was teaching my brother react by making a calculator app with him. The original project grew beyond scope after I showed him the basics. I showed him how to make a one-page app using [react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start) and decided to make a version of Conway's Game of Life and a card matching game(WIP.) I looked up the rules on wikipedia, and decided to use Material UI buttons for the squares.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run client`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run server`

Launches the server that is needed for the calculator to remember past results.


## Parts of the App

### Calculator

A simple calculator, that can perform addition, subraction, multiplication and addition.

### Conway's Game of Life



### Works Cited

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life for the rules of the game.
